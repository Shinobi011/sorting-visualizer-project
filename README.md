# Sorting_Visualizer_project

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms. I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. 

You can directly acsess it here ->  https://sorting-visualizer-project01.netlify.app/

Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

Features:
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
  -> Blue:default
  -> Yellow: Being compared
  -> Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  -> Green: In correct position
2) 3 Controls for visualizations
  -> Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  -> Data size ()
  -> Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
